# Html_And_Css_Project_Two
# Description:
This project is a responsive HTML/CSS template that I created to practice my skills in web development. The template is designed to be flexible and adapt to different screen sizes, making it easy to view and use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The template includes several key features, such as a responsive navigation menu, a flexible grid system, and customizable typography. 

# Technologies Used:
To create this project, I used pure HTML and CSS. I also used a code editor to write and test my code.
